Small todo:
  ✔ Run the planning code not once, but more time, always updating the Observations matrix; @started(14-02-26 13:41) @done (14-02-26 14:58) @lasted(1:17:00)
  ✔ Add visualization of the planning algorithm in terms of how we should move around the parking lot. @started(14-02-26 15:00) @done (14-02-26 15:14) @lasted(0:14:00)
  ☐ Maybe write a nice ground truth generator;
  ☐ Ground truth from real data needed
Further work:
  ☐ Compare the results (if can think about some other planner);
